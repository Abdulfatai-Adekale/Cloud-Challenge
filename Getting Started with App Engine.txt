###LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine
##Overview
In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

##Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
	•	Initialize App Engine.
	•	Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
	•	Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
	•	Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

##Set up your lab environment
1.	When ready, click Start LAB

2.	Note your lab credentials. You will use them to sign in to Cloud SDK.

3.	Open Cloud SDK

	Initialize the SDK
1.	gcloud init

2.	Accept the option to log in using your Google user account:
	To continue, you must log in. Would you like to log in (Y/n)? Y
	
3.	In your browser, log in to your Google user account when prompted and click Allow to grant permission to access Google Cloud resources.

4.	At the command prompt, select a Google Cloud project from the list of those where you have Owner, Editor or Viewer permissions:
	Pick cloud project to use:
	[1] [my-project-1]
	[2] [my-project-2]
		...
	Please enter your numeric choice:
	NB: Enter numeric code that corresponds to the GCP project ID given in your lab credentials. 
	
5.	Note your project ID, Compute Engine zone and region. 

##Task 1: Initialize App Engine
1.	Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:
	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
	NB: Replace $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID with your GCP project ID

2.	Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:
	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

3.	Navigate to the source directory:
	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world


##Task 2: Run Hello World application locally (for linux users)
1.	Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:
	sudo apt-get update

2.	Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application:
	sudo apt-get install virtualenv
	NB: If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.
	virtualenv -p python3 venv

3.	Activate the virtual environment:
	source venv/bin/activate

4.	Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:
	pip install  -r requirements.txt

5.	Run the application:
	python main.py

6.	Preview Application:
	gcloud app browse

7.	To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service. 

8.	Verify the App is not deployed:
	gcloud app open-console


##Task 3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine
1.	Navigate to the source directory:
	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2.	Deploy your Hello World application:
	gcloud app deploy
	NB: If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

3.	Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com:
	gcloud app browse

	Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.

##Task 4: Disable the application
1.	gcloud app instances delete
